# Level 2 - Task 1: House Price Prediction

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build machine learning models to predict house prices based on different housing-related features.

## Dataset

**Dataset:** California Housing Dataset

**File:** `housing.csv`

The dataset contains information about housing characteristics such as median income, house age, number of rooms, population, and other geographical and housing-related features.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked data types
- Identified missing values
- Handled missing numerical values using median imputation
- Checked and removed duplicate records
- Verified the dataset after cleaning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The following relationships and patterns were analyzed:

- Median income vs house value
- Housing age vs house value
- Population vs house value
- Total rooms vs house value
- Distribution of house values
- Correlation between numerical variables

Various visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Machine Learning Models

Two regression models were implemented:

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear Regression was used as a baseline model for predicting house values.

### 2. Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression was used to capture non-linear relationships between housing features and house prices.

## Data Preprocessing

- Numerical missing values were handled using median imputation.
- Categorical values were handled using most-frequent imputation.
- Categorical features were converted into numerical features using One-Hot Encoding.
- The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using an 80:20 split.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

The model with the better R² Score was selected as the best-performing model.

## Feature Importance

Random Forest feature importance was analyzed to identify the housing features that contributed most to house value prediction.

## Output

The predicted house prices were saved as:

`House_Price_Predictions.csv`

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the complete process of house price prediction using Machine Learning. Data cleaning and exploratory analysis were performed before training the regression models. Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression were compared using multiple evaluation metrics, and the best-performing model was identified.
